# Simple-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Tutorial
The purpose of this script is to provide a practical exercise #to understand generative adversial networks and the implementation code. #The script includes multiple comments that explain the process implemented #on the lines below the comment. In the script, first we create fucntions that #represent the basic elements of a GAN structure and then we put all the #elements together to create a GAN model.
